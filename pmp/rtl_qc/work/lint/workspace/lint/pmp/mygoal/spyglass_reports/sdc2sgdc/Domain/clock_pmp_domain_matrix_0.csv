# Purpose:
# This file contains the information about the relationship (sync/async) inferred 
# and relationship inferred from the constraints defined in the SDC file.
# 
# The mnemonics in the paranthesis are defined below:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
#       Mnemonic    Constraint              Relationship inferred 
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1.    SCG         set_clock_group                 Aynchronous
# 2.    SFP         set_false_path                  Aynchronous
# 3.    SCU         set_clock_uncertainity          Synchronous
# 4.    GEN         parent generated clock          Synchronous
# 5.    V2R         virtual parent real clock       Synchronous
# 6.    GRP         set_clock_group (same group)    Synchronous
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# Each cell contains information in the format
#    1. S (SCG | SFP | SCU | GEN | GRP | V2R)
#    2. A (SCG | SFP | SCU | GEN)
#    3. CE - No Domain Assigned because of cyclic Error
#            One or both Clock(s) is/are part of cyclic conflict.
#            (Refer to Txv_DomainConflict rules for details)
#                  OR
#    4. NC - No Domain Assigned since no constraint specified
#            (Refer to txv_DomainMissing for details)
#    5. NA - not applicable - for same clocks
# 
# S => Synchronous relation between the clocks. 
# A => Asynchronous relation between the clocks. 
# 
# Cells higlighted in red represent the clock pairs for which conflict 
# was detected because of either of the reasons:
# 1. set_clock_group and set_clock_uncertainity were defined for a clock pair.
#    In this case, clock pairs are considered asynchrounous.
# 2. set_clock_group and create_generated_clock were defined for a clock pair.
#    In this case, clock pairs are considered asynchrounous.
# 3. set_false_path and set_clock_uncertainity were defined for a clock pair.
#    In this case, clock pairs are considered asynchrounous.
# 4. set_false_path and create_generated_clock were defined for a clock pair.
#    In this case, clock pairs are considered asynchrounous.
# Tool-Tip Reference 1- Inferred Indirectly   
#                       The S/A relation has been assumed indirectly either due to absence of any 
#                       SDC constraints or  due to relation existing through other clocks
# Tool-Tip Reference 2- Inferred Directly from SDC constraints)
#                       The S/A relation has been assumed due to direct relation specified in SDC file
# Tool-Tip Reference 3- Inferred Indirectly with constraint
#                       The S/A relation has been assumed due to relation existing through other clocks
